At the time of writing, there are 134 build folders, mostly for a single
command, in Lunaris Core.  Although many of the programs are copyrighted by
the same people and organizations (about a dozen and a half were written by
myself, and a ton have University of California, Berkeley copyrights), this
is not true of every program in the system, and thus, many, many copyright
acknowledgements are required.

It is my general policy to avoid the "advertising clause" in all software
comprising the Core.  While that may not be fully possible, I have rewritten a
number of pieces of the system, including runtime libraries, specifically to
remove this issue entirely from the Core.

A peculiar problem exists with the indent(1) and mail(1) applications, where
two sets of copyright grants appear, with the specific license terms of the
Regents of the University of California included in the second even though the
copyright is changed, including a specific advertising clause to the Board of
Regents.  In these specific cases, and only in these specific cases, I simply
took the two texts and combined them into a single text containing all of the
relevant copyright information and the standard license grant, with the
attribution excised as the Board of Regents permits.

I understand that this could possibly be interpreted as morally, ethically or 
even legally questionable but I stand by my decision.
