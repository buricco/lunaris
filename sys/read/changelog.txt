Additions and Changes
=====================

  Changes prior to 2020/09/01 are based on analysis of the source tree, as I
  did not keep track of them prior to that date.
  
  The first release contained awk, basename, cal, cat, sleep, tee, uname and
  yacc.  (cal, tee and yacc were taken from BSD; awk is bwk awk; the remainder
  were specifically written for the project.)  Date codes are significant to
  the hour (and are in New York time).
  
  2020-07-21 21H: added units from OpenBSD.
  2020-07-21 22H: added ed, nice, nohup from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-08 03H: officially applied the name "Lunaris Core"; slight reorg of
                  the code.  Added ls from Heirloom Toolchest; mkdir, rmdir,
                  sed, who from OpenBSD; uniq, wc, whoami, xargs from Minix.
                  Wrote true, false, yes.
  2020-08-08 04H: Wrote dirname (thought I had a copy already, guess not).
                  head from OpenBSD and tail from Minix.
  2020-08-08 10H: dd, ln from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-08 11H: rm from 4.4BSD. expand, paste, sed, tr, unexpand from 
                  OpenBSD.
  2020-08-08 13H: Wrote kill, link, killall5 (first into /sbin). cut from 
                  OpenBSD. seq from NetBSD.
  2020-08-09 23H: hostname from OpenBSD. Imported Arachsys Linux's init system
                  (which might be used as the basis for a sysvinit rewrite).
                  Wrote tty.
  2020-08-10 01H: Wrote sync. Imported test from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-10 01H: Imported the C shell, so finally there's a working shell of
                  some sort.
  2020-08-10 02H: Imported the Korn shell (ksh93) from Debian. An earlier
                  version (ksh88) of the Korn shell is essentially the
                  standard POSIX shell and the basis of GNU's bash.
  2020-08-10 04H: Wrote echo (couldn't find my old implementation).
  2020-08-10 05H: cp from Heirloom Toolchest.
  2020-08-10 05H: date from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-10 09H: chmod from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-10 17H: domainname, expr, pwd from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-10 22H: Wrote dmsg. shutdown from 4.4BSD. wall from util-linux.
  2020-08-11 01H: users from Heirloom Toolchest. Imported an old PD version of
                  elvis as vi.
  2020-08-11 04H: Put strtonum in the common source tree (which later becomes
                  libunatix). Wrote df.
  2020-08-11 16H: Added a missing part of cp.
  2020-08-12 00H: du from Heirloom Toolchest.
  2020-08-13 05H: Moved basename and dirname from /bin to /usr/bin. Fixed
                  pound-bang lines in true and false. Corrected titles of link
                  and unlink. Minor fix to df. Merged pr, uuencode and 
                  uudecode from a previous attempt.
  2020-08-13 15H: stty from Heirloom Toolchest.
  2020-08-13 16H: col, colrm, column from OpenBSD.
  2020-08-13 20H: Wrote banner and chroot.
  2020-08-14 01H: Kitbashed compress.
  2020-08-14 01H: Overhauled df.
  2020-08-14 04H: cmp from OpenBSD; ftp from netkit.  Initially imported a
                  version of cron; this is removed 3 days later.
  2020-08-15 06H: Wrote sum.
  2020-08-16 04H: env, groups, mknod, renice, split, touch from Heirloom 
                  Toolchest. colcrt, factor, from, hexdump, id, lex, login, 
                  mkfifo, ping, ul from 4.4BSD. moved stty from /usr/bin to 
                  /bin. calendar, lorder from OpenBSD. comm, ctags, fmt, fold, 
                  grep, gzip, indent, join, less, logname, look, m4, mail, nl, 
                  patch, pathchk, printenv, printf, sort, su, time, tput, 
                  tsort from NetBSD. X Window version of install imported. Not 
                  sure where more entered from, but it's BSD. Not sure about 
                  ncal either, but it comes from FreeBSD. telnet from netkit.
                  Much of this may have come from my prior attempt.
  2020-08-16 05H: Wrote manual for yes.
  2020-08-17 02H: Fixed typos in copyright attributions. Tweaked some of the
                  makefiles. Purged the third clause from UCB licenses.
                  Cleaned up copyright.txt. Updates to sort (to purge it of
                  4-clause BSD licenses). Removed a stray .o file. Deleted
                  cron.
  2020-08-17 03H: bc from NetBSD. Technically it's GNU code which I have been
                  avoiding but the original author contributed it with a BSD
                  license, so all cool.
  2020-08-17 05H: Cleanup to bc.
  2020-08-20 03H: make from NetBSD.
  2020-08-20 04H: Cleanup of copyright.txt.
  2020-08-20 05H: base64, mktemp from NetBSD.
  2020-08-20 05H: finger from netkit.
  2020-08-20 08H: Makefile cleanup.
  2020-08-20 08H: More comprehensive Makefile cleanup.
  2020-08-20 09H: Updated common files. Adjustments for musl.
  2020-08-20 10H: Reworked the readme. csplit from NetBSD.
  2020-08-20 21H: More musl fixes. Removed color from ls.
  2020-08-20 22H: NetBSD curses added. ul fixed accordingly.
  2020-08-21 03H: Fixed csplit's makefile. (re)Wrote getopt.
  2020-08-21 06H: Tweaked my internal makefile generator. ps from Heirloom
                  Toolchest.
  2020-08-21 09H: Cleanup of copyright.txt. find from 4.4BSD.
  2020-08-21 12H: traceroute from 4.4BSD.
  2020-08-22 07H: Cleanup of copyright.txt, leading to another purge of Third
                  Clauses. Rewrote part of libcurses to replace 4-clause BSD 
                  code from Wasabi Systems.  shar and tftp from 4.4BSD.
  2020-08-22 10H: More purging of Third Clauses. Imported LibreSSL and zlib.
  2020-08-22 13H: Imported cURL.
  2020-08-23 11H: Cleanup of copyright.txt. Added a note about tools which
                  were brought in untouched and could easily be replaced with
                  newer versions. Added file (took a bit of working to get it
                  into our build system). Imported InfoZip (zip and unzip).
  2020-08-23 16H: Imported bzip2.
  2020-08-28 16H: Added dash (I had been wracking my brain over this for quite
                  a while as to how to get it kitbashed into our build system; 
                  in the interim I had been using the V9 shell just to be able 
                  to chroot into the dogfood environment because ksh won't
                  build for it).
  2020-08-29 03H: Added a few manuals. Imported msulogin as sulogin.
  2020-08-29 11H: cksum, mesg from 4.4BSD. ac from...a BSD? Wrote accton, line
                  and random.
  2020-08-29 14H: Pulled in Vixie cron to replace a fork that I had imported
                  previously and had turned out to be GPL'd. last from 4.4BSD.
                  whois from NetBSD.
  2020-08-30 01H: Rejigged sulogin to be more like the System V version. apply
                  from 4.4BSD. diff from Minix. rdate from NetBSD. Worked on
                  login a bit.
  2020-08-31 08H: Removed "common" and "include" folders (separated them into
                  another project). Wrote news.
  2020-09-01 09H: Tentatively added my version of mount. Fixed a bug in sync
                  (had the wrong number of required parameters).  Replaced a
                  GPL'd code generator in sh with the equivalent data from 
                  elsewhere in the tree, and changed the name of the output 
                  binary from dash to sh.  Traced the history of the project
                  and started a changelog.
  2020-09-01 22H: at, atrun from Coherent. biff from 4.4BSD.
  2020-09-02 02H: Added five entries from the BSD Games collection, all 
                  sourced from NetBSD.
  2020-09-02 05H: Added monop, robots and trek from the BSD Games Collection, 
                  also from NetBSD.
  2020-09-06 17H: Made significant changes to cat (replaced SVR2 -s with BSD
                  -s and added -etv from BSD/SVR4, with the SVR4 limitation).
                  Replaced env with a new implementation (somewhere between
                  that of 4.4BSD and the previous one, and strictly conformant
                  to POSIX).
  2020-09-07 22H: Moved env from /bin to /usr/bin. Brought over the unified
                  version of dd from my OS/2 port (same code, fewer source
                  files). Replaced logname with a new implementation, but kept
                  the man page as it was written by the IEEE and my version is
                  still strictly POSIX-conformant.  Wrote a new version of
                  hostname and domainname (this is now a single binary).  The
                  redundant BSD ln has been removed since cp has been able to
                  function as ln since the beginning.  Reimported yacc from 
                  upstream (changing it from a BSD version to a public-domain 
                  version in the process).  Partially implemented pgrep; felt 
                  the amount currently implemented was adequate even though it 
                  was incomplete.  Wrote a new version of mkdir and rmdir.
                  Wrote readlink and realpath.
  2020-09-08 05H: Corrected a couple botched UCB headers in cron.  (The files
                  mentioned in copyright.txt)  Added appropriate copyright
                  headers to all the source files in init.  Removed stray 
                  third clauses from 3 files in cksum.  Replaced mygetopt.h in
                  file with an upstream version lacking the third clause.
                  Updated the copyright header in more's main source file.
  2020-09-10 16H: Rewrote nice and renice (unifying the two).  Separated some
                  of the commands into a git repo, and resynched them in.
                    https://github.com/buricco/lc-subset
  2020-09-14 10H: Cleaned up a lot of the vi code. (sivle is a fork of the
                  previous version of elvis.)
  2020-09-18 11H: swapon from 4.4BSD, swapoff from scratch
  2020-09-18 16H: Added logger from 4.4BSD; rev, script and which from OpenBSD
                  (all of which are also in util-linux); util-linux's
                  text-utils is now fully covered.  Also supplied pivot_root.
  2020-09-19 00H: Added stat (NetBSD), timeout (NetBSD), truncate (new).
                  Except for md5sum, shred and tac, pretty much everything
                  usable in GNU coreutils is now present somehow in Core.
  2020-09-19 01H: Replaced Minix tail with 4.4BSD tail.  Also means you can
                  use "tail -r" to do what GNU's "tac" does - I might make it
                  respond to "tac" later.
  2020-09-19 03H: Replaced 4.4BSD cksum with NetBSD cksum, which supports a
                  handful of alternate algorithms.
  2020-09-19 08H: Cleaned up a few makefiles, fixed a couple broken builds
                  when isolating out a subset of the Core.  Removed tsort as a
                  major dependency was missing.
  2020-09-19 11H: Replaced MIT install with OpenBSD install, because I needed
                  -D for stuff.
  2020-09-19 15H: Dug for manpages and kitbashed a couple, read specs, 
                  replaced Minix uniq with 4.4BSD's.
  2020-09-20 17H: Replaced truncate with a better version from FreeBSD.
                  Fixed an issue with install due to missing (present in BSD)
                  function prototypes.
  2020-09-21 04H: Removed redundant groups and whoami (id supplies these).
                  Replaced Heirloom Toolchest ls with NetBSD version.
  2020-10-16 14H: Added chvt.
  2021-03-11 22H: Added -v switch to rm, since i use that a lot.
