.TH SHCOMP 1 "Fri Jun 3 2005" KSH93 "User Environment Utilities"
.SH NAME
shcomp \- compile a ksh93 shell script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shcomp
[
.I options
] [\fIinfile\fP] [\fIoutfile\fP]]
.SH ORIGIN OF THIS MAN PAGE
This man page was written by Christophe Martin <Schplurtz@free.fr>
for the
.B Debian
.B GNU/Linux
system. It is based on "shcomp \-\-man" output.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Unless
.I \-D
is specified,
.B shcomp
takes a shell script,
.IR infile ,
and creates a
binary format file,
.IR outfile ,
that
.B ksh93
can read and execute with the same
effect as the original script.
.PP
Since aliases are processed as the script is read, alias definitions whose
value requires variable expansion will not work correctly.
.PP
If
.I \-D
is specified, all double quoted strings that are preceded by $ are
output. These are the messages that need to be translated to locale specific
versions for internationalization.
.PP
If
.I outfile
is omitted, then the results will be written to standard output.
If
.I infile
is also omitted, the shell script will be read from standard input.
