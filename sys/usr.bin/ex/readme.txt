This is a fork of the "elvis" editor, version 1.8p4, which is intended to
specifically clean out a lot of the cruft from supporting old and obscure
operating systems which were still in common use when the previous version was
released.  Additionally, it provides a fairly solid implementation of vi for
the operating system I have been developing.

Version 1.8p4 contained no copyright attribution, only the author's name and
a date of publication, and the intention that the program be "freely
redistributable", a vague statement.  Two specific actions by the author
suggest that what I have done, by placing my fork specifically under the UIUC
license with his name on it for the original code and mine for adaptations and
modifications, is within the author's intentions.

First, the immediately next version, 2.0, has a license agreement that says
only that the copyright attribution (new to that version) be kept.  I have
added such an attribution to this version.

Second, the very same version from which this program forked, was the basis of
the "nvi" editor originally released by Keith Bostic and the Regents of the 
University of California under the standard 4.4BSD license.  The terms I have
used are not 100% verbatim-identical to the 4.4BSD terms but the requirements 
are identical.

I do not believe that there should be any issues, morally, ethically or
legally, with this action; but just in case, I have stated the grounds on
which the decision was made.
