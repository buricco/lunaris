.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In form.h
.Ft int
.Fn field_just "FIELD *field"
.Ft int
.Fn set_field_just "FIELD *field" "int justification"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Field justification is only applied to static fields, a dynamic field
will not be justified.
The default justification for a field is
NO_JUSTIFICATION.
The
.Fn field_just
will return the current justification value of the given field and the
justification may be set by calling the
.Fn set_field_just
function.
.Sh PARAMETERS
The following are the valid justifications for a field:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width NO_JUSTIFICATION -compact
.It NO_JUSTIFICATION
No justification is to be applied to the field.
In practice, this is the same as JUSTIFY_LEFT.
.It JUSTIFY_RIGHT
The field will be right justified.
That is, the end of each line will
be butted up against the right hand side of the field.
.It JUSTIFY_LEFT
The field will be left justified.
That is, the start of each line
will be butted up against the left hand side of the field.
.It JUSTIFY_CENTER
The field will be centre justified, padding will be applied to either
end of the line to make the line centred in the field.
