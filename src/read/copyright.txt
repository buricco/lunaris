This project is formed of disparate subprojects, each with its own copyright,
On occasion, pieces of those subprojects may be extracted from other projects
with their own copyrights.  This file attempts to contain, in a single place, a 
full list of copyright and non-copyright acknowledgements which pertain to 
various components within this project, as well as any acknowledgements which
are required to be present in promotional material, or in all publications.

It is certainly possible that some acknowledgements may have been overlooked.

  2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries) must 
     reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this 
     list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials provided with 
     the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition is redistribution

     variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different 
     capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip", "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the explicit 
     permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further prohibited

     for the altered versions.
  4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP", "Zip", "UnZip", 
     "UnZipSFX", "WiZ", "Pocket UnZip", "Pocket Zip", and "MacZip" for its own

Copyright: 1982-2012, AT&T Intellectual Property

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC 
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and
    ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
      are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
      'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
      Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
      Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: 
        (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with 
            the Program under their own license agreement, and 
        (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly 
     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, 
     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of 
     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is 
     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such 
     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license 
     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the 
     Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses 
     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor 
     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other 
     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or 
     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted 
     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure 
     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a 
     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute 
     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license 
     before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
     license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that:

  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
  b) its license agreement:
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
       conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of 
       title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
       merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
        damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within 
the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, 
if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify 
the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, 
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, 
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and 
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified 
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims 
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: 
  a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and 
  b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
     Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
     negotiations. 
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own 
expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If 
that Commercial  Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers 
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a 
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of 
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the 
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to 
or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of 
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the 
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself 
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted 
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement 
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to 
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to 
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The 
Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement 
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will 
be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the 
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program 
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly 
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or 
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, 
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. 

All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are 
reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial 
in any resulting litigation.
