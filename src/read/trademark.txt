History As Regards Trademark Justification
==========================================

  The project was established sometime before January 26, 2007, when the
  original toolchain (called Fox) was committed to Sourceforge's SVN server
  for the first time.  I know that I was using the "Lunaris" term as a working 
  title at the time, although the project was actually being produced under 
  the name "Kaban".
  
  I have records dating July 14, 2013 and August 5, 2013 where I describe a
  potential project resembling the current project, and use the term "Lunaris"
  to refer to said project.  Reference to the intention of making it like
  "Unix" is found on July 14, 2013, along with an explanation of the name; a
  few hours later, musl is proposed as its C library; clang as its system C
  compiler, sysvinit (eventually replaced, but the underlying philosophy was
  maintained) as the init system, and some form of the Korn shell as the
  system shell, on September 25 of the same year.
  
  The name first appears in the documentation for the new version of the
  toolchain (initially codenamed "tewlz") on July 21, 2020.  This was renamed
  to "Lunaris Core" on August 3, 2020 (hence, "luncore" appears in the release
  files as the base of the distribution tree).  As mentioned, "Lunaris" had
  been established as the name of the project, 
  
  Two existing registered trademarks are known to exist as of the time of
  writing, but neither is in a field remotely related to my project.

The "Official" Trademark Claim
==============================

  As founder and lead of the project openly called "Lunaris" since 2013 at the
  latest, and of the "Lunaris Core" project first released to public 
  availability on July 21, 2020, I hereby declare my trademark claim on the
  term "Lunaris", so far as it relates to "computer operating system software 
  to facilitate computer use and operation".
  
  I understand that this does not establish Lunaris in this context as a
  registered trademark.
  
  No claims are hereby made on any copyrights or patents that may affect the
  project.
