This replaces the OpenBSD version of byacc which was formerly included in the
Lunaris Core collection with one taken from upstream and more recently
updated.

It is the release of March 30, 2020, from https://invisible-island.net/byacc/

I have not altered the code, just stripped it down and rewritten the makefile.

yyfix.1 and yyfix.sh are left intact from the previous release as they are
separate from byacc but have been included with it in the BSDs.
