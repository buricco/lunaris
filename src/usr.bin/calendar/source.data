Oliver Elphick:

  From the tables in the Book of Common Prayer, I think Easter Sunday should
  be April 4.  These dates are dependent on Easter:

  Septuagesima Sunday:             Jan 31
  Shrove Tuesday:                  Feb 16
  1st day of Lent (Ash Wednesday): Feb 17
  Palm Sunday:                     Mar 28
  Maundy Thursday:                 Apr  1
  Good Friday:                     Apr  2
  Easter Day:                      Apr  4
  Easter Monday:                   Apr  5
  Rogation Sunday:                 May  9
  Rogation days:                   May 10-12
  Ascension Day:                   May 13
  Whitsunday/Pentecost:            May 23
  Trinity Sunday:                  May 30
  Advent Sunday:                   Nov 28

Daniel Martin:

  Calendar has these three - Yom HaAtzma'ut happens 20 days after
  passover, unless that would put it on a Friday or Saturday, in which
  case it happens on the Thursday prior.  Lag BaOmer happens 33 days
  after passover and Yom Yerushalim happens 43 days after passover.
  This puts them for next year on April 21st, May 4th, and May 14th,
  respectively.  (I got these by reading calendar's lisp code)

  >   07/31*  Fast of Tish'a B'Av (Babylon/Rome destroys Holy Temple; fast
  >         day)
  Next year this happens on 7/22

  >   10/12*  Shmini Atzeres/Simchas Torah (Rejoicing of the Law;
  >         sabbatical)
  This always happens the day before Simchat Torah.  Next year that puts
  it on October 2nd.

  Rogation Sunday is the Sunday before Ascension Day; that puts it last
  year on May 17th, and in 1999 on May 9th

Julian Gilbey:

  An almost complete calendar for 1999 (including all the ones you had
  queries about):

  02/01   Tu Bishvat (New Year for Trees)
  03/01   Fast of Esther
  03/02   Purim (Jews rescued from decrees of Haman)
  03/03   Shushan Purim (Purim in Jerusalem)
  04/01-04/08  Pesach (Passover)
  04/14   Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial Day)
  04/20   Yom HaZikaron (Israeli Fallen Soldiers Remembrance Day)
  04/21   Yom HaAtzmaut (Israel Independence Day)
  05/04   Lag Ba`omer (Commemoration of the Great Rebellion)
  05/14   Yom Yerushalayim (Reunification of Jerusalem)
  05/21-05/22   Shavuot (Pentecost)
  07/01   Fast of Shiv'a Asar B'Tammuz (Romans breach Wall of
          Jerusalem; fast day)
  07/22   Fast of Tish'a B'Av (Babylon/Rome destroys Holy Temple; fast
          day)
  07/28   Tu B'Av (Festival of Fifteenth of Av)
  09/11-12   Rosh Hashanah (New Year)
  09/13   Fast of Tzom Gedaliah (Fast commemorating assassination of
          Gedaliah, the head of the Jewish community in Israel during
          the Babylonian exile)
  09/20   Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement; fast day)
  09/25-10/01   Sukkot (Tabernacles)
  10/01   Hoshana Rabbah (Day of final appeal for a good judgement; part
          of Sukkot)
  10/02   Shmini Atzeret (Eighth day of Festival)
  10/03   Simchat Torah (Rejoicing of the Law)
  12/04-12/11   Chanukah (Festival of Lights)
  12/19   Fast of Asara B'Tevet (Babylonians put siege on Jerusalem;
          fast day)
  (Also, it's on 12/29/98 this year, and not as in the current calendar,
  but never mind.)

  Finally, I've used the Orthodox dates for Diaspora Jewry (i.e.,
  outside of Israel).  In Israel and outside according to the Reform
  (and possibly Conservative) practice, Pesach is one day shorter,
  Shavuot is only one day, and Shmini Atzeret and Simchat Torah become
  one day (10/02).

Those are Christian holidays? I've never heard of any of them!
As it is, I put down more dates than 99% of all Chrisitans would
care about (even Catholics - but that may just be due to poor christian
education in north america). If you want to go to extremes, you could
add all the saints days. :)

I have to admit that I don't know what this is for. One thing I'd love
to see with a list of holidays is a description of what the holiday is.

Anyway, using a dictionary and the web, I came up with the following.
Hopefully you can add the string describing when the holiday is as a
comment somewhere:

http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/asb/cal/cal.html
contains a lot of useful information. The only part that doesn't agree
well is its definition of Ember Days.

> Feb 11  Septuagesima
the 3rd Sunday before Lent (or the 9th before Easter)
27 Jan 2002
16 Feb 2003
> Feb 18  Sexagesima
The second Sunday before Lent; -- so called as being about the sixtieth day before Easter.
 3 Feb 2002
23 Feb 2003
> Feb 25  Quinquagesima
the Sunday before Ash Wednesday
10 Feb 2002
 2 Mar 2003
> Mar 04  Quadragesima (1st Sunday of Lent)
dates below

(from the web)
  Ember day: A day reserved for prayer and fasting by some Christian churches,
  observed on the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after the first Sunday
  of Lent, after Whitsunday, after September 14, and after December 13.
(Whitsunday: the seventh Sunday after Easter)
Or
  Ember Days are the Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays within the weeks
  before the Third Sunday in Advent, the Second Sunday in Lent, and the
  Sundays nearest to the Festivals of St Peter, and St Michael and All
  Angels. On these days prayer is offered for all who serve the Church in
  its various ministries, both clerical and lay, and for all who are to be
  ordained or commissioned to those ministries. Ember Days may also be
  observed on such days as are directed by the Bishop.
This does not agree with the previous definition except for the week
during Lent:
 - St. Michaels and All Angels is 29 Sep (much later in the month)
 - St. Peter is 29 Jun (much later in the month)
 - The dates you gave for 2001 and the previous definition point to the
   week AFTER the Third Sunday in Advent
The first definition was used to give the dates below.

> Jun 05  Ember day
> Jun 07  Ember day
> Jun 08  Ember day
Shouldn't those have been 6, 8 and 9? Jun 5, 2001 was a Tuesday.

17 Feb 2002 Quadragesima
20 Feb 2002 Ember day
22 Feb 2002 Ember day
23 Feb 2002 Ember day
 9 Mar 2003 Quadragesima

15 Mar 2003 Ember day

19 May 2002 Whitsunday

19 Dec 2003 Ember day
20 Dec 2003 Ember day

> May 20  Rogation Sunday
5th Sunday after Easter
> May 21  Rogation Day
  Rogation Day: In western Christendom, prescribed days of prayer and fasting
  traditionally for the harvest, usually the three days before Ascension Day
Ascension day is the Thursday after the 5th Sunday after Easter.
31 Mar 2002 Easter
 5 May 2002 Rogation Sunday
 6 May 2002 Rogation Day
 7 May 2002 Rogation Day
 8 May 2002 Rogation Day
 9 May 2002 Ascension day
20 Apr 2002 Easter
25 May 2003 Rogation Sunday
26 May 2003 Rogation Day
27 May 2003 Rogation Day
28 May 2003 Rogation Day
29 May 2003 Ascension day

Except for not being 100% positive on how the Ember days are set, this
looks like it should be accurate. It would be a good idea for someone
to check it (calendar mode in emacs is very handy). Hope this helps. :)
